# CLAUDE CODE CRITICAL REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVES

## MANDATORY CRITICAL CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST - EXECUTE ALL POINTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION

### 1. BUG DETECTION AND ELIMINATION
YOU MUST SCAN EVERY SINGLE LINE OF CODE FOR BUGS! LOOK FOR:
- NULL POINTER DEREFERENCES AND UNHANDLED NONE VALUES
- OFF-BY-ONE ERRORS IN LOOPS AND ARRAY INDEXING
- RACE CONDITIONS IN CONCURRENT CODE

WHEN YOU FIND A BUG, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY FLAG IT WITH SEVERITY LEVEL AND PROPOSE A FIX!

### 2. IDENTIFYING AND FIXING TERRIBLE DESIGN DECISIONS
CRITICALLY ANALYZE EVERY ARCHITECTURAL DECISION! LOOK FOR:
- GOD OBJECTS THAT DO EVERYTHING - SPLIT THEM IMMEDIATELY!
- CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN MODULES - REFACTOR THE ARCHITECTURE!
- HARDCODED VALUES THAT SHOULD BE CONFIGURABLE
- TIGHT COUPLING BETWEEN COMPONENTS THAT SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT
- MISSING ABSTRACTION LAYERS WHERE NEEDED

- INCORRECT USE OF DESIGN PATTERNS (SINGLETON ABUSE, FACTORY EXPLOSION)
- SYNCHRONOUS CODE WHERE ASYNC WOULD BE BENEFICIAL
- BLOCKING I/O IN PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL PATHS
- MISSING CACHING WHERE EXPENSIVE OPERATIONS ARE REPEATED
- INCORRECT DATA STRUCTURES (USING LISTS WHERE SETS/DICTS WOULD BE O(1))
