   - Multiple time period support
   - Trend analysis

2. **Smart Categorization**
   - Rule engine setup
   - Category mapping
   - Auto-categorization logic

3. **CSV Import**
   - Parser implementation
   - Field mapping
   - Duplicate detection

### Following Weeks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cash Flow Tool Enhancement
```typescript
interface CashFlowAnalysis {
  period: string;
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  inflows: {
    total: number;
    daily: number;
    sources: CategoryBreakdown[];
  };
  outflows: {
    total: number;
    daily: number;
    categories: CategoryBreakdown[];
  };
  netFlow: number;
  trend: 'increasing' | 'decreasing' | 'stable';
  forecast: {
    next7Days: number;
    next30Days: number;
  };
}
```

### Categorization Engine
```typescript
interface CategorizationRule {
  id: string;
  priority: number;
  conditions: {
    merchantPattern?: RegExp;
    amountRange?: { min?: number; max?: number };
    descriptionKeywords?: string[];
    dayOfWeek?: number[];
    isRecurring?: boolean;
  };
  category: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

### CSV Import Architecture
```typescript
interface CSVImportJob {
  id: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  fileName: string;
  totalRows: number;
  processedRows: number;
  imported: number;
  duplicates: number;
  errors: ImportError[];
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
}
```

## Success Metrics
